# ChatGPT-AI-Voice-Assistant
The above code is a Python program that uses various libraries and APIs to create a voice-enabled AI assistant. The AI assistant is designed to answer user questions and engage in natural language conversations. The program uses the SpeechRecognition library to capture user speech input, the pyttsx3 library for text-to-speech output, and the OpenAI API to generate text-based responses. The GUI for the AI assistant was built using the Tkinter library. Users can ask questions by speaking into the microphone, and the AI assistant will respond with generated text and voice.
